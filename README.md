# Hello, I'm Symphony 👋🏾

I'm a second year M.S. Student passionate about integrating data science with psychology. Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am currently enrolled in a text mining course that covers text analytics— the practice of extracting valuable insights from unstructured text, including sources like social media, emails, and web pages, using Python. Over the next few months, my projects will revolve around applying text mining techniques.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, R
- **Tools and Packages:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Tableau, pgAdmin, Azure Data Studio, Jupyter, MS Office
  
## 🔭 Current Projects

- [Google Seach Text Analytics](https://github.com/symphopkins/Google_Search_Text_Analytics/blob/main/Google_Search_Text_Analytics.ipynb): We're acting as data scientist at the Department of Transportation, tasked with enhancing our road condition dashboard. To gather more search data, our manager enables us to monitor Google Search feeds, extracting the latest 100 weather-related searches for word cloud creation and named entity recognition.
- [Text Manipulation Using ReGex](https://github.com/symphopkins/Google_Search_Text_Analytics/blob/main/Google_Search_ReGex_Text_Cleaning.ipynb): Similar to before, we are extracting the latest 100 weather-related Google searches; however, we will use regular expression (regex) to clean the text data.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! 😄
